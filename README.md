# Investigation of Strength in 3D-Printed Metallic Components  

## Overview  
This project focuses on the material strength and surface roughness evolution of metallic components manufactured using Material Extrusion (MEX) 3D printing technology with metal-polymer filaments. The study explores additional processes such as debinding and sintering and their impact on the final material properties, including strength and surface quality.

## Key Features  
- **Technology**: MEX 3D printing with metal-polymer filaments, processed using debinding and sintering stages.  
- **Focus Areas**:  
  - Surface roughness evolution from printed to sintered states.  
  - Impact of surface roughness on material strength.  
  - Metallographic analysis of printed and sintered samples.  
- **Materials Studied**: BASF Ultrafuse metal-polymer filaments for MEX 3D printing.  

## Results  
- Strength results were consistent with findings in existing literature on metallic 3D printing.  
- No significant strength changes observed with variations in surface roughness.  
- Surface roughness increased significantly post-debinding and sintering processes.  
- Metallographic analysis revealed notable porosity in sintered samples.  

## Significance  
The project demonstrates the potential of MEX 3D printing for manufacturing metallic components but highlights the need for further optimization of material properties to reduce porosity and enhance performance.
